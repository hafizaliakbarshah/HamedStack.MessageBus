   ```

2. **Define Commands and Queries**:

   ```csharp
   public class MyCommand : ICommand
   {
       public string Data { get; set; }
   }

   public class MyQuery : IQuery<string>
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
   }
   ```

3. **Create Handlers**:

   ```csharp
   public class MyCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<MyCommand>
   {
       public Task Handle(MyCommand command)
       {
           // Handle command
           return Task.CompletedTask;
       }
   }

   public class MyQueryHandler : IQueryHandler<MyQuery, string>
   {
       public Task<string> Handle(MyQuery query)
       {
           // Handle query and return result
           return Task.FromResult("Result");
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Send Commands and Queries**:

   ```csharp
   await mediator.Send(new MyCommand { Data = "Test" });
   var result = await mediator.Send(new MyQuery { Id = 1 });
   ```
